AND the existing connection has a valid certificate for the name that is being sought.\r\n\r\nRob notes the prohibition in [Section 3 of RFC 6066](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#page-8) where it states:\r\n```\r\nIf the server_name is established in the TLS session handshake, the client SHOULD NOT attempt to request a different server name at the application layer.\r\n```"

This enacts that change, and adds a congruent use of the Alt-Svc header field for use in contexts other than HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nThat means that the Service header field can be removed safely.\r\n\r\nI've also added some notes regarding tracking of clients.

Otherwise, certain use cases are made more difficult (not impossible, but certainly cumbersome).\r\n\r\nThinking more on this, the text I'm arguing with Herve on in #464 is probably worthwhile, but it would need to be retargeted.  The point here is that a closed node that is high up in the priority tree is a useful construct for performing large-scale reprioritization changes, explicitly pointing this out means that we have a higher chance that servers keep nodes around if they continue to be used.  That is, branch nodes with active leaves are retained as long as possible; nodes close to the root are retained as long as possible.\r\n\r\n(I'm not sure that I could device a sorting algorithm that would optimally determine what nodes to keep, but that's probably something for implementation \"secret sauce\".)"

Compression effectively creates a delineation similar to what segments allow; aligning the two would avoid issues with reframing, padding and other related concerns.\r\n\r\nOf course, we would need rules that governed how frames are marked.  The obvious one is to require all frames in a segment to be uniformly compressed or uncompressed, not a mix of the two.\r\n\r\nThen there are the drawbacks, which are that more state is required to process streams because a compression context is maintained over a longer period, not just for the time it takes to decompress/compress a frame.  Since this is an optional feature, I'm thinking that this is a manageable cost."

If the server needs to shut down, it will send a GOAWAY acknowledging the last request it processed.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a race condition where a request could be in flight or queued. When the server eventually sees the delayed requests, it will not process it and the proxy will eventually return an error (most likey 5xx) to the client.\r\n\r\nRequiring proxies to buffer the request in order to replay for this case is not feasible.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to have the server send an ALTSVC frame, but this is not ideal as it implies each server must keep track of a list of alternatives. It may not make sense for the origin server itself to maintain this (potentially quickly changing) list.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to allow acknowledging unreceived streams in the GOAWAY. For instance, the server could acknowledge last-stream-id plus SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS. This might work in practice, but seems hacky.\r\n\r\nAnother (and in my view best) solution would be to introduce a two phase shutdown mechanism. Some strawman language: \"If a server needs to shut down for maintenance, the server SHOULD immediately send a DRAINING frame on all its client HTTP/2 connections to indicate that it will soon shut down. This allows the client to stop issuing new requests and avoids unnecessary retries. After a reasonable amount of time, the server SHOULD send a GOAWAY with status NO_ERROR on all its connections and then close the connection. Clients MAY may open new connections to the server after receiving a DRAINING frame.\""

    "body": "In Firefox, we refuse servers' requests for client certificates if we've done connection coalescing on a connection. This has potential interop issues. For example, Apache can be configured to require a client certificate (via a TLS renegotiation) only upon the first request to some particular paths. This can easily put us in a state where we cannot access such paths:\r\n\r\n1. Browser connects to https://foo.example.org\r\n2. Browser coalesces https://bar.example.org onto that same connection.\r\n3. Browser requests https://foo.example.org/requires-cert.\r\n4. Server requests (demands) client cert\r\n5. Browser refuses to send one.\r\n6. Server returns 401/403/whatever error.\r\n\r\nNote that in theory coalescing could happen before any requests are sent on the connection. Thus, this has the potential to make some client-certificate-required resources completely inaccessible to the client, unless the client retries the request. The client probably won't retry the request, and may not be allowed to if it isn't idempotent.\r\n\r\nBesides the problems with connection coalescing, TLS renegotiation doesn't fit well with browser UI. In particular, it is possible for the server to send a different server cert in a renegotiation than it sent in the initial handshake. It could do this renegotiation even in the middle of a request or response, even in HTTP/1. This problem is even more likely to occur in HTTP/2 because transactions are multiplexed instead of being serialized. The browser thus cannot map requests/responses to certificates in a well-defined way. Yet, usually browsers present server identity in such a way that would make any server certificate change potentially misleading to the user.\r\n\r\nI am sure we can think of many reasons why TLS renegotiation is a bad idea for HTTP servers (of any version). It's probably too late to do anything meaningful about it for HTTP/1 since clients have to deal with existing servers that do it. it would be great to improve things for HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nHowever, because TLS <= 1.2 sends the client certificate in the clear, many implementations (including, IIRC, IIS in its default configuration) do a handshake without a client certificate and then immediately renegotiate to get the client certificate, to protect the client's identity. Thus, we probably cannot prohibit renegotiations that occur at the start of the handshake. A further complication is that TLS False Start interacts poorly with such schemes because the client may send a request on the connection before the server can even request the renegotiation that it intended to occur before any requests were made."
