That is the `GOAWAY` frame and the `last stream identifier` only limit the ability of the receiver?\r\n\r\nIf this is correct, and I believe it is, then I find the following sentence in the first paragraph at `6.8 GOAWAY` confusing.\r\n\r\n> Once sent, the sender will ignore frames sent on any new streams with identifiers higher than the included last stream identifier.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it should say something of the like \r\n\r\n> Once sent, the sender will ignore frames sent on any new streams **created by the receiver** with identifiers higher than the included last stream identifier.\r\n\r\nThanks."
